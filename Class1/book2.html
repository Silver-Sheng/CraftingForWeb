      This book is a memoir with a lot of illustrations, which somehow brings me
      back to my childhood when reading picture books. I resonate with the
      drawing and its use of language a lot and learn a new perspective and
      attitude for facing the downside of life. This book has a magic healing
      power that allows me to slow down the pace of my life and take time to
      truly face the negative emotions that hid deep down my heart.
