      <p>
        “100 Anti-theses on Cyberfeminism” is a manifesto that aims at defining
        what Cyberfeminism is not as the First Cyberfeminist International
        agreed on not to define the term cyberfeminism.
        <br />
        As Guertin says that cyberfeminism is a celebration of multiplicity.
        This manifesto critically discourses the concept of cyberfeminism and
        advocate not limiting the definitions and possibilities for
        cyberfeminism.
