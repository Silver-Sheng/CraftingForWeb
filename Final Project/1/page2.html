          The overall environment of online society is much more hostile and
          negative than in the real world. Many netizens start to judge or
          comment on others on social media before they fully understand what
          happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          In most cases, they unscrupulously make judgemental comments and
          spread malice to others due to the herd mentality, impulse, and the
          anonymous nature of the Internet. This phenomenon is referred to as
          cyberbullying. They lost the ability to empathize with the victim
          under such irrational conditions. Such behavior would lead to severe
          consequences to the victim such as depression, Irreversible
          psychological damage, loss of privacy and normal daily life, and even
          suicide.
