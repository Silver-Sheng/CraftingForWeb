      Reading paper books is another way I like to use to to release my stress.
      This traditional medium has the power for clearing out distractions and
      organizing my mind. The minute I hold a book in my hand, the woody and the
      lovely smell of the book would calm me down. The book
      <a href="book2.html">I Used to Have A Plan: But Life Had Other Ideas</a>
      helped me go through a difficult time in my life. It gave me a great sense
      of comfort when I struggled with several chaotic changes happened in my
      life.
