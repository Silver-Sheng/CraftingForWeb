      Create an interactive hypertext narrative that reveals something about
      yourself or an experience you've had. It could be a story about yourself
      or an experience you had, a journey through a topic you're interested in
      or are researching, a mode of navigation that mimics your mood or
      personality. There should be multiple HTML pages, linked together by a
      tags. Each page could contain text and/or images. No styling. Limit your
      focus to story and html tags.
