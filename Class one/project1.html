    <p>
      Hi there,
      <br />
      <br />
      this is Silver!
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm currently a first-year grad student in the NYU IDM program. I am
      currently interested in studying user experience design and installation
      art. I major in media arts and minored in film production during my
      undergraduate study. I change to study interaction design because I found
      myself more interested in interactive and immersive experiences.
      <br />
      <br />
      Recently, I feel a bit overwhelmed by my life and schoolwork. I'm now
      looking for
      <a href="page2.html">things that make me happy</a>
      .
