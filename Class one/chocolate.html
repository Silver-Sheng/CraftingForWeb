    <p>
      I am a big fan of chocolate-flavored desserts and snacks, such as
      chocolate cake, chocolate ice cream, chocolate cookies, and chocolate
      mochi. I specifically like eating chocolate desserts and snacks when I am
      having a bad mood. This is one way for me to release my stress, which
      makes me curious about why I will feel better when eating chocolate
      desserts. After searching on the internet, I learned that Chocolate
      contains a small amount of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan">tryptophan</a>
      , an amino acid, which is linked to the production of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin">serotonin</a>
      , which is a neurotransmitter that produces feelings of happiness.
      Besides, eating something sweet can cause a surge in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine">dopamine</a>
      by going quickly from the stomach to the bloodstream and then to the
      brain. Dopamine is the hormone that causes feelings of happiness,
      excitement, and joy.
