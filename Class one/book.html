      Reading paper books is another way I like to use to to release my stress.
      This traditional medium has the power for clearing out distractions and
      organizing my mind. The minute I hold a book in my hand, the woody and the
      lovely smell of the book would calm me down. The book
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Used-Have-Plan-Other-Ideas/dp/0062973622">
        I Used to Have A Plan: But Life Had Other Ideas
      </a>
      helped me go through a difficult time in my life. It gave me a great sense
      of comfort when I struggled with several chaotic changes happened in my
      life. This book is a memoir with a lot of illustrations, which somehow
      brings me back to my childhood when reading picture books. I resonate with
      the drawing and its use of language a lot and learn a new perspective and
      attitude for facing the downside of life. This book has a magic healing
      power that allows me to slow down the pace of my life and take time to
      truly face the negative emotions that hid deep down my heart.
