      Going back to what I have tried before, I realize that drawing is almost
      the only thing that I persist in for so many years. I used to learn piano,
      tennis, dance, calligraphy, and so on, but I gave up all these interests
      halfway through. (

      ) My parents used to not like me spending too much time drawing. I
      remembered when I was a kid, I asked them if I can go to a drawing time
      several times and they
      <a href="drawing2.html">never</a>
      agreed.
