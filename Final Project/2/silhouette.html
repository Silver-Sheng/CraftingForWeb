          Overview:
          <br />
          It starts from a little boy’s childhood experience. His mom is mean to
          him after his sister passed away. He tries many ways to behave well to
          get his mom's approval and care, but all his mom did is scolding him.
          The only time that his mom hugs here are when he dresses up as his
          sister. Throughout his early life, the little boy hides in the closet
          whenever he feels unsafe. After he grows into a teenager, he misses
          the only time that he could get someone’s attention. He begins to
          secretly try on his mom's dress and appreciate his beauty in front of
          the mirror. His mom finds out about his secret hobby and scolds him.
          Later, his mom can’t stand him anymore and leaves him. Since then, he
          releases himself from his mom’s control and starts to dress like a
          female, and makes lots of new friends. He lives as a normal person
          happily until one day he receives his mom’s gift during his birthday.
