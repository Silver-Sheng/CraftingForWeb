          Before taking this class, I haven’t really thought of the feminist and
          political elements that hide behind the construction of the internet
          and website. This week’s reading about cyberfeminism is very
          informative and thought-provoking. After reading the cyberfeminist
          manifesto, there were too many thoughts in my head, which make me
          don’t know where to get started from. I first think of cyberfeminism
          as an individual subject from traditional feminism concepts but then
          Sue’s statement make me realize that cyberfeminism is one kind of
          variation and transformation based on the development of human society
          and technology. Mindy Seu’s Cyberfeminist Index defines and explains
          the concept of cyberfeminist and helps me get a better understanding
          of Claire L. Evans’ Feminist Worldbuilding in the Australian
          Cyberswamp, which **examines the rise and history of the VNS Matrix.

          Rosa Menkman‘s Glitch Studies Manifesto is thought-provoking. The
          overall typesetting visualizes and enhances the main statements in the
          article. The words and sentences are physiognomic and shaped in an
          untraditional format. I learn a different perspective to view and
          utilize glitches and disintegration. Menkman examines the significance
          and potential of the glitch in relation to the development of culture
          and society.

          When reading J.R Carpenter’s A Handmade Web, I found it interesting
          that the handmade web is closely linked to the creator and a person’s
          identity and how people view handmade web and public big sites
          differently. They host the creator’s identity in personal ways and are
          one of a kind. The handmade web has more intimate and quieter. The
          emotions contained in a handmade web seem to be more obvious and the
          connections between people and handmade we are stronger. Reading this
          article makes me realize a phenomenon that not only happens in the
          internet world but exists in the entire human development history.
          People always tend to start from something small and intimate to
          something big, popular, and crowded, whereas, somehow, in the end,
          people would always find a way to slow down and go back to the initial
          idea with something quieter and smaller.

          In Olia Lillian’s “Vernacular Web”, the concept and statement about
          translucency, transparency, and how developers and users perceive the
          web provides me with a new way of thinking about the current usage and
          functionality of the web. I believe I am one of the amateurs and users
          that almost know nothing about how a web is crafted or functions as
          Olia mentioned in the article. I used to think that an efficient and
          understandable interface is a good and necessary quality, but now I am
          not sure if this is still a good thing for the user or if it
          imperceptibly enlarges the gap between the user and understanding the
          interface and the mindset between designers and users. Besides, It is
          quite interesting to learn that web2.0 has more attraction or features
          but still follows some rules and traditions from web1.0 and
          non-digital mediums.

          When reading Laurel Schwulst’s article, I really like and agree with
          how Laurel Schwulst describes the website as “they’re both subject and
          object at once. In other words, a website creator becomes both author
          and architect simultaneously.” I completely agree with Laurel
          Schwulst’s opinion that the “web needs to actually work for people
          instead of being powered by a small handful of big corporations.” It
          makes me start thinking of the power dynamics within the web, and the
          relationship between developers and users. I am inspired by how Laurel
          Schwulst uses metaphors to demonstrate how flexible a website can be
          and what world people can create with its possibilities and potential
          for each individual.
