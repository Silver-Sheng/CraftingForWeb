          For the final project, I decide to create a hand-code portfolio site
          for the projects I have done before. I struggled a lot at first as I
          was trying to decide if I want to create a narrative storytelling
          website or a practical portfolio website as the final project. As
          struggling for a while, I believe that a portfolio website may be a
          better practice and showcase for the technical skill I have learned
          throughout this class. Besides, this is one of my motivations and goal
          for taking this class.
          <br />
          <br />
          I met a few difficulties during the process of coding this website. I
          struggled a lot when designing the layout and spent some time learning
          how to code it in the way I want, for instance, the numbers and sizes
          of rows and columns and the space between them. I also struggled with
          the font, font size, and line space between them. The most important
          thing for me to consider is the affordance and readability of the
          website. After figuring out the layout, I began working on the
          interaction with each section and element of the website, such as how
          can the navigation text be a clear indicator of where you are and how
          to show which image or text can be clicked on. I chose to use the
          hover effect for the text and image for better reading and interaction
          experience. The color of the text will change and the project images
          would drop 3D shadow when the mouse moves over.
          <br />
          <br />
          This site is still incomplete and may never be complete as this is a
          place I will continue to store my future work.

          This week Shoshana Zuboff’s reading on surveillance capitalism is
          really insightful and thought-provoking. This is the first time I
          learn about surveillance capitalism. However, after learning about
          this concept in the reading, I somehow feel familiar with the term and
          consider it as a demonstration and summary of some of my thoughts on
          today’s digital social media and technology development. I have a fear
          about the future of humanity and how would people view and interact
          with each other. There is a tendency that people are being treated as
          data points for collecting human behavior and predicting the future
          and possible behavior through analysis. Digital data and information
          is out of an individual’s control. There are a lot of cases of
          unexpected information leaks and uninformed use of personal data. I’m
          curious and a bit worried about how digital data and information will
          be used and what form they may turn into in the future.

          Frank Chimero’s What Screens Want is a very insightful reading. I’m
          deeply inspired by the discussion and exploration of the screen and
          the concepts he introduces. As Chimero states, “screens are
          aesthetically neutral.” It is a medium or interface that would not
          limit the thing that is presented or created inside it. I found the
          discussion about metaphors and abstractions in this reading quite
          insightful. Metaphors and abstractions may help people understand
          things better but may also create misinformation, distortion, or
          biases. I somehow related to Chimero’s worries, since the internet
          industry developed and changed so frequently that before most users
          haven’t clearly understood how the webs work and develop, it seems
          settled now and limits its possibilities. The web we are seeing right
          now is lack variations and contains bias and assumptions. We shall
          develop more perspectives ways and aims in viewing and using the web.
          <br />
          <br />
          Besides, after reading this article, it makes me wonder that the
          screen may also be a temporarily popular medium/material that is
          widely used in the current age because it now has the best flux, as
          Chimero referred to, that we need and want now. If, in the future, a
          new and more effective medium is invented for handling abstractions,
          changes, and transformations, how will the screen be seen and placed?

          In Chancey Fleet’s Dark Patterns in Accessibility Tech talk, she
          illustrates the importance of accessibility features in the digital
          ecosystem. This talk reminds me of something I learned from another
          class a couple of weeks ago, Accessibility features are not only
          useful for disabled people. All people are actually using the
          advantage and convenience of the accessible feature. I completely
          agree with Chancey’s statement that we should change the “perception
          that accessibility features are for disabled people” and realize that
          “we share one ecosystem and they are for everyone.” Accessibility
          features should not be viewed as edge cases but as infrastructure. The
          inclusion of accessibility technology during development is critical
          not only to disabled people and their interests but will develop a
          more equitable and better digital ecosystem for all people. Reading

          In Protocol, written by Alexander Galloway, the Introduction chapter
          examines the development of computer protocol and explains some
          commonly used concepts related to the internet protocol. This reading
          helps me a lot in learning why and how the internet/website is a
          political space as the professor mentioned in the first class.
          Galloway argues that the founding principle of the internet and
          related technologies is not freedom, but control, which makes me
          realize that there is a management and power distribution system that
          lies behind the technical protocols. Do we, the individuals, have more
          power and freedom in the current society with easy access to the
          internet and related technologies or we have been put in a massive
          invisible power net that control by the authorities? Does an
          individual truly have control of their information? What is the actual
          relationship between the individual and the web? These are the
          questions that bother me for a long time. I am trying to learn more
          about the political relationship between digital media and technology
          through readings and practice.

          Feminist Server Summit Afterlife is an informative female server
          manifesto. I am deeply impressed and inspired by some of its
          statements, such as “does not confuse safety with security” and “…Is
          autonomous in the sense that she decides for her own dependencies.”
          This manifesto provides strong statements about cyberfeminism and
          concepts of the female server.

          Before taking this class, I haven’t really thought of the feminist and
          political elements that hide behind the construction of the internet
          and website. This week’s reading about cyberfeminism is very
          informative and thought-provoking. After reading the cyberfeminist
          manifesto, there were too many thoughts in my head, which make me
          don’t know where to get started from. I first think of cyberfeminism
          as an individual subject from traditional feminism concepts but then
          Sue’s statement make me realize that cyberfeminism is one kind of
          variation and transformation based on the development of human society
          and technology. Mindy Seu’s Cyberfeminist Index defines and explains
          the concept of cyberfeminist and helps me get a better understanding
          of Claire L. Evans’ Feminist Worldbuilding in the Australian
          Cyberswamp, which **examines the rise and history of the VNS Matrix.
          <br />
          <br />
          Rosa Menkman‘s Glitch Studies Manifesto is thought-provoking. The
          overall typesetting visualizes and enhances the main statements in the
          article. The words and sentences are physiognomic and shaped in an
          untraditional format. I learn a different perspective to view and
          utilize glitches and disintegration. Menkman examines the significance
          and potential of the glitch in relation to the development of culture
          and society.

          When reading J.R Carpenter’s A Handmade Web, I found it interesting
          that the handmade web is closely linked to the creator and a person’s
          identity and how people view handmade web and public big sites
          differently. They host the creator’s identity in personal ways and are
          one of a kind. The handmade web has more intimate and quieter. The
          emotions contained in a handmade web seem to be more obvious and the
          connections between people and handmade we are stronger. Reading this
          article makes me realize a phenomenon that not only happens in the
          internet world but exists in the entire human development history.
          People always tend to start from something small and intimate to
          something big, popular, and crowded, whereas, somehow, in the end,
          people would always find a way to slow down and go back to the initial
          idea with something quieter and smaller.
          <br />
          <br />
          In Olia Lillian’s “Vernacular Web”, the concept and statement about
          translucency, transparency, and how developers and users perceive the
          web provides me with a new way of thinking about the current usage and
          functionality of the web. I believe I am one of the amateurs and users
          that almost know nothing about how a web is crafted or functions as
          Olia mentioned in the article. I used to think that an efficient and
          understandable interface is a good and necessary quality, but now I am
          not sure if this is still a good thing for the user or if it
          imperceptibly enlarges the gap between the user and understanding the
          interface and the mindset between designers and users. Besides, It is
          quite interesting to learn that web2.0 has more attraction or features
          but still follows some rules and traditions from web1.0 and
          non-digital mediums.
          <br />
          <br />
          When reading Laurel Schwulst’s article, I really like and agree with
          how Laurel Schwulst describes the website as “they’re both subject and
          object at once. In other words, a website creator becomes both author
          and architect simultaneously.” I completely agree with Laurel
          Schwulst’s opinion that the “web needs to actually work for people
          instead of being powered by a small handful of big corporations.” It
          makes me start thinking of the power dynamics within the web, and the
          relationship between developers and users. I am inspired by how Laurel
          Schwulst uses metaphors to demonstrate how flexible a website can be
          and what world people can create with its possibilities and potential
          for each individual.
