    <p>
      I know I should go to bed early, but I just cannot stop thinking of things
      I have not finished in the day or browsing my phone. There are so many
      things that need to be done in the day, but I only have so limited amount
      of time. I deeply enjoy the time when I can just lie down, do nothing,
      recharge from the peacefulness and quietness and fall asleep naturally
      without melatonin.
