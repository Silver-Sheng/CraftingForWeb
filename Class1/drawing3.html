    <h1>Why I Never Give Up Drawing</h1>
    <p>
      Drawing is one of my favorite and most efficient way to relax and release
      stress. When I feel overwhelmed by school, work or people, I will start
      drawing something to distract myself from real life or sometimes escape
      from the mess in my life. I am always easily distracted by things around
      me, except when I am drawing. I enjoy every moment of drawing and how I am
      able to pay full attention to it. I feel safe and comfortable while
      drawing. This process would help me clear the negative energy in my mind
      and calm down. It helps me able to organize my thoughts and face problems
      later. (A random fun fact: there is a phrase in Chinese called
      three-minutes passion, which is use for describe this kind of personality.
      I found this is quite an accurate and interesting expression.)
